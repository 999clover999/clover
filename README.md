Put the .exe in a folder you want the images in! Don't put it on desktop or it will download all the files there.

How to use it:

--start the program, wait a sec.

--choose 4Chan or 4Channel (with big C) !!! IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH ONE YOU INPUT FOR NOW (05/01/2019) THIS INPUT IS THERE TO CATCH ANY ERRORS IN FUTURE !!!




--select board, input with / /, example: /c/

--now select thread ID, that's the last part of the link, example: https://boards.4chan.org/c/thread/2932664 ENTER 2932664
