The program can downlaod .jpg .gif .webm and .png

How to use it:

--start the program, wait a sec.


--now choose which one you want and input without " . ", so " .gif " is FALSE but " gif " is TRUE

:::::. If you choose .jpg and there is a .gif file in thread it WILL WORK, but the file will be saved as .jpg, same with .png, If you post it it will even change to .gif

--select board, input with / /, example: /c/


--now select thread ID, that's the last part of the link, example: https://boards.4chan.org/c/thread/2932664 YOU WILL ENTER    2932664  


--Wait for the program to finish 


--pres Enter to close


--Move the files to another folder so it wont get messy, I would create specific folders for specific threads because name limit is 1000

And the MOST IMPORTANT THING
