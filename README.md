How to use it:

--start the program, wait a sec.

--select board, input with / /, example: /c/

--now select thread ID, that's the last part of the link, example: https://boards.4chan.org/c/thread/2932664 ENTER 2932664  

--Wait for the program to finish 

Put the .exe in a folder you want the images in.

And the MOST IMPORTANT THING 
Bully me in every possible way I like it(unironically)
